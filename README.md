# Project Description
### What it Does
This website is an experiment for me to use Node.js and further develop my front-end skills. The site is an example of an airline website where users can look at flights, look at their trips, check in to a flight, check a flight status, and learn more about the airline.

### Motivations
I wanted to build this site as part of my portfolio for website development to show my skills with APIs and the Node.js framework as well as animations with CSS and JavaScript and user experience design.

### Features
In this first version, there is only a basic layout with a page for each link in the navigation. 

##### Coming Soon
- Animated flipboard with JavaScript to show flight statuses
- Animated SVGs to show flight paths on a map
- Micro-interactions for user experience
- Real-time flight information from an API (TBD)
- Encrypted logins for users stored in a database (MongoDB or SQL)
